## Image Classification App: Pizza, Steak, or Sushi

Welcome to the Image Classification App for distinguishing between pizza, steak, and sushi! This app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications. With this app, you can easily upload an image and get predictions on whether it's a pizza, steak, or sushi.

## How to Use
### Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-app.git`

### Install Dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the App:
`streamlit run app.py`


### Upload Images:
Once the app is running, you can upload images directly through the interface.

### View Predictions:
After uploading an image, the app will process it and provide predictions on whether it's a pizza, steak, or sushi.

## Technologies Used
Streamlit: Used to create the interactive web application.
Python: The primary programming language used for development.
Pytorch: Used for training the image classification model.
Pre-trained model used: resnet18 with modifications and fine tunning.

## Model Details
The image classification model used in this app is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It has been trained on a dataset containing images of pizzas, steaks, and sushi to accurately classify new images into one of these categories.

## Credits
This app was created by [Manoj Shendre].
The dataset used for training the model was sourced from [Food101].
